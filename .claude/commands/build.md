Build a project in this workspace.

If `$ARGUMENTS` specifies a project name, build that specific project:
```
npx nx build <project-name>
```

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, build all affected projects:
```
npx nx affected -t build --base=origin/master --parallel=5
```

If the build fails, analyze the error output and fix the issues. After fixing, re-run the build to verify.
